INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF INDIVIDUALS
Last Updated: 15 January 2024
Year of Assessment 2024

1. TAX RESIDENCY STATUS

1.1 Determining Tax Residency
You are considered a tax resident for a particular Year of Assessment (YA) if you are a:
â€¢ Singapore Citizen who normally resides in Singapore
â€¢ Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR) who has established your permanent home in Singapore  
â€¢ Foreigner who has stayed/worked in Singapore for 183 days or more in the year before the YA

1.2 Tax Treatment Differences
The tax treatment differs significantly between residents and non-residents:

| Status | Tax Rate | Reliefs Available | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resident | Progressive (0-24%) | Yes |
| Non-Resident | Flat 15% or Progressive (higher) | No |

2. INCOME TAX RATES FOR RESIDENTS

2.1 Progressive Tax Rate Table (YA 2024)
The following progressive tax rates apply to resident individuals:

| Chargeable Income | Tax Rate | Gross Tax Payable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First $20,000 | 0% | $0 |
| Next $10,000 | 2% | $200 |
| Next $10,000 | 3.5% | $350 |
| Next $40,000 | 7% | $2,800 |
| Next $40,000 | 11.5% | $4,600 |
| Next $40,000 | 15% | $6,000 |
| Next $40,000 | 18% | $7,200 |
| Above $200,000 | 22% | - |

Note: For income above $1,000,000, the rate is 24%

Example: For a chargeable income of $85,000:
- Tax on first $80,000 = $3,350
- Tax on next $5,000 at 11.5% = $575
- Total tax = $3,925
