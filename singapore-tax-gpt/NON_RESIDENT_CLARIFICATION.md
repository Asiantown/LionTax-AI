# Non-Resident Tax Rates - Important Clarification

## ⚠️ Rate Changes in 2024

There's been confusion about non-resident tax rates because they CHANGED in 2024:

### OLD Rates (Until YA 2023):
- Employment income: 15% or progressive (whichever higher)
- Director's fees & other income: **22%** ← This is outdated!

### CURRENT Rates (From YA 2024):
- Employment income: 15% or progressive (whichever higher) 
- Director's fees & other income: **24%** ← Increased in 2024!

## 📊 The Correct Answer for 2024

### Employment Income:
- **15% flat rate** OR progressive resident rates (whichever is HIGHER)
- NOT a flat 22% as some sources may state

### Why "whichever is higher"?
- Low earners: Pay 15% (more than resident rates)
- High earners: Pay progressive rates (more than 15%)

### Examples:
1. **$30,000 salary:**
   - 15% = $4,500 (non-resident pays this)
   - Resident would pay ~$200
   - Non-resident pays MORE

2. **$500,000 salary:**
   - 15% = $75,000
   - Progressive rates = ~$88,150 (non-resident pays this)
   - Non-resident pays the HIGHER amount

### Other Income:
- Director's fees: **24%** (not 22%)
- Business income: **24%** (not 22%)
- Professional fees: **24%** (not 22%)

## 🔍 Source of Confusion

Many websites and advisors still quote the OLD 22% rate because:
1. It was the rate for many years until 2023
2. Not everyone has updated their information for 2024
3. Some sources confuse the employment income rate with other income rates

## ✅ Official IRAS Sources Confirm:

From IRAS website (checked Dec 2024):
> "From YA 2024, the tax rate for non-resident individuals (except on employment income and certain income taxable at reduced withholding rates) increased from 22% to 24%."

> "Non-resident employment income is taxed at 15% or resident rates, whichever is higher."

## 📝 Key Takeaways:

1. Employment income is **NOT** taxed at flat 22% or 24%
2. It's 15% OR progressive (whichever higher)
3. The 22% rate is OUTDATED (now 24% for non-employment income)
4. Always check IRAS website for current rates
