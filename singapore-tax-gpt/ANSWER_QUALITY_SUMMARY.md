# Answer Quality - Perfect Balance Achieved ✅

## The Problem
Answers were too brief and lacked helpful context:
```
GST rate: 9% (as of 2024). Registration required if turnover > S$1,000,000
```

## The Solution
Found the perfect balance - informative but concise:
```
GST (Goods and Services Tax) rate: 9%
• Increased from 8% to 9% on 1 January 2024
• Applies to most goods and services in Singapore
• Registration required if annual turnover exceeds S$1 million
• Some items are zero-rated (exports) or exempt (financial services, residential property)
```

## Answer Structure Formula

### 1. Main Answer (1 line)
Clear, direct statement answering the question

### 2. Context Points (3-5 bullets)
• Key detail 1 (most important)
• Key detail 2 (qualification/condition)
• Key detail 3 (useful context)
• Key detail 4 (exception/special case)

### 3. Total Length
5-7 lines maximum - enough to be helpful, not overwhelming

## Examples of Perfect Balance

### GST Rate
```
GST (Goods and Services Tax) rate: 9%
• Increased from 8% to 9% on 1 January 2024
• Applies to most goods and services in Singapore
• Registration required if annual turnover exceeds S$1 million
• Some items are zero-rated (exports) or exempt (financial services, residential property)
```

### Corporate Tax
```
Corporate income tax rate: 17% (flat rate)
• Applies to all companies, both local and foreign
• Singapore uses a one-tier system - dividends are tax-free to shareholders
• Partial tax exemption available: 75% exemption on first S$10,000, 50% on next S$190,000
• Start-ups enjoy additional tax exemptions in first 3 years
```

### Non-Resident Tax (More Complex)
```
Tax rates for non-residents in Singapore:

EMPLOYMENT INCOME:
• 15% flat rate OR progressive resident rates (whichever produces HIGHER tax)
• This means if resident rates would result in more than 15% tax, you pay the higher amount
• No personal reliefs or $20,000 tax-free threshold

EXAMPLE CALCULATIONS:
• $30,000 income: 15% = $4,500 (vs resident tax of ~$200, so pay $4,500)
• $500,000 income: Progressive rates = ~$88,150 (vs 15% = $75,000, so pay $88,150)

OTHER INCOME TYPES:
• Director's fees: 24% flat rate
• Business/professional income: 24% flat rate

## Principles Applied

1. **Answer the question immediately** - Don't bury the lead
2. **Add essential context** - What else would they need to know?
3. **Include recent changes** - Like GST going from 8% to 9%
4. **Mention exceptions** - Zero-rated items, special cases
5. **Keep it scannable** - Bullet points, not paragraphs
