Key details:
‚Ä¢ The rate increased from 8% to 9% on 1 January 2024
‚Ä¢ GST applies to most goods and services supplied in Singapore
‚Ä¢ Businesses must register for GST if their annual taxable turnover exceeds S$1 million
‚Ä¢ Some supplies are zero-rated (0% GST, mainly exports) or exempt (financial services, residential property sales/rental)
‚Ä¢ The 9% rate is one of the lowest consumption tax rates globally"""

**Employment Income:**
‚Ä¢ Taxed at 15% flat rate OR progressive resident rates - whichever is HIGHER
‚Ä¢ Example: S$30,000 salary = 15% tax (S$4,500) since resident rate would be lower
‚Ä¢ Example: S$500,000 salary = progressive rates (~S$88,150) since it's higher than 15%

**Other Income Types:**
‚Ä¢ Director's fees: 24% withholding tax
‚Ä¢ Professional/consultancy fees: 24% of net income or 15% of gross income
‚Ä¢ Rental income: 24% 
‚Ä¢ Interest: 15% withholding tax
‚Ä¢ Royalties: 10% withholding tax

**Important Notes:**
‚Ä¢ Non-residents get no personal reliefs or S$20,000 tax-free threshold
‚Ä¢ Tax-exempt if working ‚â§60 days (except directors, entertainers, professionals)
‚Ä¢ Rates increased from 22% to 24% for most non-employment income in 2024"""

‚Ä¢ Monthly take-home: ~S$6,387

**Child Relief:**
‚Ä¢ S$4,000 per child √ó 2 = S$8,000
‚Ä¢ Conditions: Children must be unmarried, under 16, or studying full-time
‚Ä¢ If handicapped: S$7,500 per child instead

**Parent Relief:**
‚Ä¢ S$9,000 per parent (if supporting both parents = S$18,000)
‚Ä¢ Conditions: Parents must be 55+, earning ‚â§S$4,000, and you must support them with ‚â•S$2,000 annually
‚Ä¢ If handicapped: S$14,000 per parent
‚Ä¢ Can be shared among siblings

**Additional Automatic Reliefs:**
‚Ä¢ Earned Income Relief: Lower of S$1,000 or 1% of income (automatic)
‚Ä¢ CPF Relief: Based on your CPF contributions (automatic)

**Total Potential Relief:**
‚Ä¢ S$27,000+ from family reliefs alone

**Key Features:**
‚Ä¢ Applies to both local and foreign companies on Singapore-sourced income
‚Ä¢ One of the most competitive rates in Asia
‚Ä¢ Territorial tax system - foreign income generally not taxed unless remitted

**Tax Exemptions:**
‚Ä¢ Partial exemption: 75% exempt on first S$10,000, 50% on next S$190,000
‚Ä¢ This means effective rate is lower for smaller profits
‚Ä¢ Start-ups get additional exemptions: 75% on first S$100,000, 50% on next S$100,000 for first 3 years

**One-Tier System:**
‚Ä¢ Dividends are tax-free in shareholders' hands
‚Ä¢ No dividend withholding tax
‚Ä¢ Makes Singapore attractive for holding companies

**Example:** 
Company with S$200,000 profit pays ~S$29,325 tax (effective rate ~14.7% due to exemptions)"""
