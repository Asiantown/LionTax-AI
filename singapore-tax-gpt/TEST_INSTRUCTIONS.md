# How to Test the Q&A Improvements

## Quick Test Commands

### 1. Test Specific Questions
```bash
# Test tax rates
python qa_working.py "What are the current income tax rates?"

# Test calculation
python qa_working.py "Calculate tax for 80000"

# Test reliefs
python qa_working.py "How much is spouse relief?"
python qa_working.py "What is child relief?"

# Test GST
python qa_working.py "What is the GST rate?"
```

### 2. Run Comprehensive Test
```bash
# This tests all 9 critical questions
python test_all_improvements.py
```

### 3. Run Evaluation Suite
```bash
# Test enhanced system only
python evaluate_qa.py

# Compare old vs new system
python evaluate_qa.py --compare
```

## What to Look For
